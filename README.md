## Features:
- Printing out the last 100 Messages to the console

- Downloading those same messages

## Drawbacks:
- This cant use a bot token and requires a user token. I will not personally provide a guide but they are out there!

- This is limited to only the last 100 messages currently I am working to find a way to download more I am gonna try to!

- Possible Account bans - Please note using discord api in this way is techincally against there tps and therefore can result in punishment even with the low chance of it


## How to guide:

#1 Get your discord token

#2 Go into the .env file and replace "put your discord token here [not a bot token]" with your token

#3 Run the script and paste the channel id

#4 It will print the messages it finds and download them to a txt file with the same name as the channel

#5 Enjoy!
